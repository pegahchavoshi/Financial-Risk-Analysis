# Netflix Financial Risk Analysis

# Abstract
Netflix, Inc. is a streaming platform and production company that has been growing rapidly in recent years. This report analyzes Netflix's financial performance over the past 10 years, highlighting areas where the company has excelled and areas that need improvement. Additionally, the report predicts the company's performance over the next ten years, using revenue and other factors to calculate the net present value and internal rate of return. The report concludes by discussing the potential risks associated with Netflix's business model and how the company can manage these risks effectively.

# Introduction
This report provides an in-depth financial analysis of Netflix, focusing on the company's performance over the past decade and its prospects for the future. The report also examines the risks associated with Netflix's business model and how the company can mitigate these risks.

# Business Model
Netflix operates through different segments, including domestic and international streaming, and domestic DVD. The company's revenue comes primarily from subscriptions, which is also the company's main source of risk.

Netflix has recently made an announcement regarding a monthly premium membership rate increase from $12.99 to $17.99, resulting in a $4 hike. The impact of this decision will be analyzed through the use of historical data to compare previous and future cash flows. The model presented here provides an analysis of uncertainty in financial forecasting for Netflix, as the company weighs the decision of whether or not to increase its membership costs.

# Financial Analysis

This section provides an analysis of Netflix's financial performance over a decade-long period, from 2011 to 2020. During this time, the company's revenue grew from 3.21 billion to 25 billion, representing an increase of 8.06%. Meanwhile, the cost of revenue increased from 2.05 billion to 15.28 billion, indicating an increase of 7.45%. Table 1 displays the financial statement of Netflix for the aforementioned period. Notably, the company's net income surged from 226 million in 2011 to 2.76 billion in 2020. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 illustrate Netflix's revenue and net income trends over the same period, respectively.

The model presented herein provides a forecast of Netflix's cash flow for the next ten years, incorporating uncertain inputs such as revenue, tax rate, average number of subscribers, cost of goods sold, average monthly revenue per paid subscriber, and operating expenses. Fixed annual growth rate for revenue and subscription cost growth, as well as an annual loss rate, were also considered in the model (refer to Table 2 for details). The future cash flow was computed by factoring in the calculated revenue, annual growth rate, tax, loss, and subscription cost per user. For example, the revenue for the years 2021 to 2030 was calculated using the following formula:

Revenue = Initial Revenue x Fixed Annual Growth Rate + Initial Revenue + (Average Monthly Revenue per Paid Subscriber x 12 months)

The Monte Carlo simulation method was used in this model to predict the probability of various outcomes when random variables are introduced. One such variable is the tax rate, which was assigned a value of 37% with a "Normal" distribution. As shown in Table 1, the range of possible values for this input is -34.384% to 63.006%, with parameters of 0.1268 and 0.15094. The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution with a probability density function of fx=1/√(2πσ^2) * e^(-(x-μ)^2/2σ^2). The mean and standard deviation of the tax rate are also calculated in the table. The graph in Fig. 3 shows a 91.4% chance that the tax rate will fall between -0.152 and 0.370. The expected value of the tax rate is equal to its mean, which is 0.1268.
